An \openshmem program consists of a set of \openshmem processes called \acp{PE}
that execute in an \ac{SPMD}-like model where each \ac{PE} can take a different
execution path. For example, a \ac{PE} can be implemented using an OS
process. The \acp{PE} may be either single or multithreaded.
The \acp{PE} progress asynchronously, and can communicate/synchronize
via the \openshmem interfaces.  All \acp{PE} in an \openshmem program should
start by calling the initialization routine \FUNC{shmem\_init}%
\footnote{\FUNC{start\_pes} has been deprecated as of \openshmem[1.2]}
or \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread} before using any of the other \openshmem library routines. 
An \openshmem program concludes its use of the \openshmem library when all \acp{PE} call
\FUNC{shmem\_finalize} or any \ac{PE} calls \FUNC{shmem\_global\_exit}.
During a call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}, the \openshmem library must
complete all pending communication and release all the resources associated to
the library using an implicit collective synchronization across \acp{PE}.
Calling any \openshmem routine after \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} leads to undefined
behavior.

The \acp{PE} of the \openshmem program are identified by unique integers.  The
identifiers are integers assigned in a monotonically increasing manner from zero
to one less than the total number of \acp{PE}. \ac{PE} identifiers are used for
\openshmem calls (e.g. to specify \OPR{put} or \OPR{get} routines on symmetric
data objects, collective synchronization calls) or to dictate a control flow for
\acp{PE} using constructs of \Cstd or \Fortran. The identifiers are fixed for
the life of the \openshmem program.

\subsection{Progress of OpenSHMEM Operations}\label{subsec:progress}

The \openshmem model assumes that computation and communication are naturally
overlapped. \openshmem programs are expected to exhibit progression of
communication both with and without \openshmem calls. Consider a \ac{PE} that is
engaged in a computation with no \openshmem calls. Other \acp{PE} should be able
to communicate (\OPR{put}, \OPR{get}, \OPR{atomic}, etc) and
complete communication operations with that computationally-bound \ac{PE}
without that \ac{PE} issuing any explicit \openshmem calls. One-sided \openshmem
communication calls involving that \ac{PE} should progress regardless of when
that \ac{PE} next engages in an \openshmem call.

\textbf{Note to implementors:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item An \openshmem implementation for hardware that does not provide
      asynchronous communication capabilities may require a software progress
      thread in order to process remotely-issued communication requests without
      explicit program calls to the \openshmem library.  
  \item High performance implementations of \openshmem are expected to leverage
      hardware offload capabilities and provide asynchronous one-sided
      communication without software assistance.
  \item Implementations should avoid deferring the execution of one-sided
      operations until a synchronization point where data is known to be
      available. High-quality implementations should attempt asynchronous delivery
      whenever possible, for performance reasons. Additionally, the \openshmem
      community discourages releasing \openshmem implementations that do not
      provide asynchronous one-sided operations, as these have very limited
      performance value for \openshmem programs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Errors}\label{sec:errors}

Most \openshmem operations may report errors. Errors can originate from 
passing invalid arguments to \openshmem operations, or from 
unexpected runtime conditions, such as a resource exhaustion, a processor 
or network link failure, etc. These failures can be observed by setting an 
appropriate \OPR{error handler} for the error code representing the 
considered type of failure. 

Invalid arguments generally result in undefined behavior, however, a 
debugging version of an \openshmem implementation may check for invalid 
arguments and report errors.

Unexpected runtime failures may prevent the successful completion of \openshmem 
operations. Implementations are encouraged to report the occurence of failures 
with an appropriate error code, and strive not to leave any \ac{PE} deadlocked 
in an operation disrupted by a failure. However, depending on the severity of 
the failure, it may not always be possible to do so.

When an \openshmem implementation has reported an error, operations possibly do
not respect their specification. In particular, a synchronizing operation may 
return before synchronizing, or the data objects could be partially 
or incorrectly updated. It is also to be noted that, due to the one-sided
nature of \openshmem operations, when an error is reported at 
an origin \ac{PE}, incorrect behavior may also be observed at
the target \acp{PE} without that \ac{PE} reporting an error. It is possible 
to force an error to be reported at all \acp{PE} by calling the predefined
error handler \textit{SHMEM\_ERRHANDLER\_GBREAK}.

After an error has been reported, continued use of the \openshmem 
library may not be possible. However, the memory allocated for 
symmetric data objects remains available at the local \ac{PE}, giving the 
application a chance to verify the correctness of the data, take checkpoints 
before exiting, or continuing using a resilient communication library.
